# Simple LR Parser in C

This is a simple LR parser or SLR parser that I coded by hand as a research project. I find the best way to understand something is to code it. So I did just that.

### ParseTable.md
This file contains the rule set used, a list of the item sets, as well as the final parse table. This is what I used in order to map out how the parser would work.
